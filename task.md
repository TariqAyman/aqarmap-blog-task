Feel free to use your preferred Frontend framework you like (Vue or Angular for example) or you can normally use twig views to build your frontend. whatever you are used to and comfortable with, also feel free to use bootstrap or even foundation to build the frontend or even a ready-made template you like.





A small hint, we are not trying to measure your problem-solving skills here as you may notice the task is very straightforward and simple, I already touched your problem-solving capabilities in the interview, we need to measure how far your code quality in a small project can go, make sure you deliver a high-end code quality.
